### Reflection

- Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Some of the topics helped me to develop my app, but I had to learn on my own how to create popups and use embenced youtube

- If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.

I would add a carousel to make it prettier, maybe also some navigarion bar for each genere and add responsiveness to it. Also, maybe I would add some dynamic search, to not press enter to see your movie.

- Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I would like to add more styiling and create a lot of reusable functions instead of writing them all the time. That was something I could improve.

### Shout out

Give a shout out to somebody from your cohort that especially helped you during your project. This can be a fellow peer, instructor, TA, mentor, etc.

Thank to Thomas for helping me debuging a little of my project, he didn't say the answer but he guided me to get it.
Also thanks to Tim for teaching me to debug like an engineer.
